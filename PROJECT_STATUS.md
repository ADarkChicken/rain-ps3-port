# PROJECT STATUS: Rain (PS3 → Windows x64)

Last updated: 2026-10-25 (M5 COMPLETE, 311/311 types. M6 approved; integration started, paused for next session).

## Where we are
**Phase 5: M0–M4 COMPLETE; M5 (reconstruct the Stage-1 slice closure) APPROVED 2026-10-17, in progress.**
| Item | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Host | **Unity 2017.4.40f1** (D9), x64 D3D11 player builds/runs; skeleton + PS3 shims compile; vtable layout resolved | E63–E73 |
| M1 Assets | Class readers byte-exact on all objects; DXT native; Stage 1 exported (now 6,388 GOs, 3,905 renderers incl. 1,482 MapInstantiation copies, 809 meshes, 134 mats, 123 tex incl. 13 lightmaps) and imported with identical counts; materials bound to `RainPS3/*` (134/134); lightmaps (754 renderers, runtime `RainLightmaps`) + render settings applied | E74–E78, E83 |
| M2 Shaders | 1,282/1,282 RSX programs → HLSL compile (d3dcompiler); 183/183 shaders → ShaderLab, all supported in Unity, 0 errors, x64 build OK | E79–E82 |
| M3 VS-1 | **Complete.** x64 player shows Stage 1 (E93); golden structure match edge NCC 0.70/0.79/0.67 ≥ 0.65 (E92). Built: keyword bridge, lightmaps + light probes, MapInstantiation map build (1,482 copies), RainCommon/RainMerge post effects reconstructed from code, shader fixes (scalar uniforms, PS3 depth decode, texture row order). Carried to VS-2: rain systems (wet reflections, rain/mist), sun shafts, DOF | E83–E93 |
| M4 Toolchain | **Complete.** T2 field layout/chains, T3 vtable resolver, T4 0 unresolved generic names, T5 lift packets + compile harness; benchmark 44/53 A (83 %), all compile | E94–E96, BENCHMARK_M4.md |
| M5 Slice logic | **In progress.** Closure (direct calls, level4 + 41 st01 prefabs): 146 script classes → 212 top-level types / 4,339 methods (`work/maps/st01_closure*.csv`). All 238 types decompiled with switch recovery + lifted (`work/decomp_st01`, `work/lift_st01`, local). Layout rule corrected (E97). Queue finished 2026-10-19: 209/212 types full + 3 partial by design, 3878/4339 methods, all compile; replay PASS 1137/FAIL 227 (all environment). Gap: types reached only via fields/inlined accessors are outside the closure (E101) | E97–E101 |

**Exact next action:** M6 (VS-2 "boy walks in the rain") APPROVED 2026-10-25, integration started this session, **paused (token budget) before it compiles** -- resume by picking up the compile-fix step below.

**M6 dependency map** (local only, `work/m6_dependency_map.md`): of the 311 reconstructed types, 152 are critical-path for the walk/camera/region/rain vertical slice (player movement+anim, core game/input/scene loop, PathCamera family, PathGraph/nav, Region*/Trigger*, Rain*/CreateRainDrop); 159 are deferred (AI/enemy behaviour, audio, UI/save/menu -- already done separately, cutscenes, the Gimmick/AcqObject interactive-object system, misc render effects, the AsCommandNew AI-script VM).

**Data pipeline extended and verified:** `tools/rain_export.py` generalised `post_effect()` into `script_component()` (E40's MonoBehaviour-field decoder, already proven byte-exact at M1, just never run for gameplay classes): decodes any of the 93 critical-path classes that actually have MonoBehaviour instances (59 of the 152 are base/abstract/singleton with 0 instances, nothing to extract), resolves PPtr fields to scene object ids. Verified against a real export: 1,272 script-component instances across 77 classes, 0 decode errors; spot-checked against known figures (RegionBox count 239 matches E77 exactly) and PPtr resolution (e.g. `m_RegionTriggerArray` resolves to a real `level4@N` id). Re-ran into `work/export/st01/scene.json` (local, unpushed) -- this is live and correct.

**Unity-side importer extended, not yet working:** `tools/unity/RainImport.cs` gained a small hand-written MiniJSON parser + reflection-based `AttachScripts()` (generic field setter: Vector/Quaternion/Color/Rect/Bounds/curves/arrays/List<T>/enums/LayerMask/Color32, PPtr fields resolved against the imported GameObjects or materials) so any of the 93 classes' decoded fields can be set on a real attached component without per-class C# boilerplate. Also added (tracked, hand-written, not decompiled): sun-shaft parameter fields + `CopyParameter`/`ChangeColorCollectionMode` on `RainCommonPostEffect`/`RainMergePostEffect` (M3 left these out; PathCamera/GlobalParam/CutSceneManager need them to compile -- data fields only, no actual sun-shaft rendering yet), and `tools/unity/Runtime/_RainEngineStubs.cs` (compile-only empty placeholders for engine-extension types the recon scripts merely *reference*: Unity Standard Assets image effects PostEffectsBase/DepthOfFieldSimple/GlobalFog/GlowEffect/etc., Shroud cloth `ShroudInstance`, PS3 SGX audio wrapper classes, `CutScene`/`CutSceneData`; NOT reconstructed logic).

**Blocked on (compile regression, the actual next step):** copying all 311 recon `.cs` files into `port_unity/Assets/RainRuntime/Recon` (local, gitignored) got compile errors down 349 -> 60 -> 19 -> **3** (all in our own new RainImport.cs code, fixed: a `mcp__patch` fuzzy-match bug kept corrupting a `'\r'` char-literal escape into a raw CR byte -- fixed by direct byte-level edit, verify this way again if it recurs; also one C# 4.0 pattern-matching incompatibility). Then adding `Rain.Firstpass.dll` as a Plugins reference to resolve ~17 leftover cross-tier type names (`CutScene`, `ShroudInstance`, SGX*, `PostEffectsBase`, etc.) caused a NEW regression: it duplicate-defines `RainCommonPostEffect`/`RainMergePostEffect` against our own hand-written versions (CS0433 in the Editor assembly) -- removed the plugin. Stubbing those ~17 names directly (`_RainEngineStubs.cs`) got past the "type not found" errors but then cascaded into **219 member-access errors**: cutscene/Shroud/SGX-audio call sites need real members (properties/methods), not just empty classes -- i.e. compiling these deferred-subsystem files at all requires reconstructing those subsystems, which is out of scope for M6. **Correct fix (not yet done): exclude the 159 deferred-bucket files from `Assets/RainRuntime/Recon` (move them out per the dependency map above) and keep only the 152 critical-path files** -- should return to the "3 errors, all fixed" checkpoint. After that: run the import, check `AttachScripts` field-set counts/errors in the log, then get the boy actually moving (needs a camera/input entry point -- not yet identified) before any RPCS3 side-by-side comparison (ask first, per standing rule).

**Previously done (2026-10-25):** M5 reconstruction queue COMPLETE: AsCommandNew (322 stubs, 6 sequential split passes, sonnet-5-5) was the last partial type, all passes compiled clean on the first or second try. RuntimeMisc's last stub (`ObjectArray_NameSort`) was mislabeled `nopacket` by an earlier agent - it actually had a packet (`work/lift_st01/RuntimeMisc.md:1791`, a cost-keyed selection sort) and is now implemented. Queue: 311/311 types done, 5819/5819 methods, 315 recon types, all compile. Replay: PASS 660 / PASS~ 958 / FAIL 121 / FAIL~ 182 / EXC 124 / EXC~ 279 / SKIP 187 (AsCommandNew's AI-script methods aren't exercised by the current replay samples, so no new PASS/FAIL - expected, not a red flag). AsCommandNew `// unverified` highlights: `EnableResistant` BigParameter+0x180 write omitted (no recon field), `Command_AutoMoveAlternativePoint_vs` confirmed correct against the packet (discards `FindNearestPoint`'s result, moves to the original point either way), 1 `sic` (`Command_IsRangeOut_bfu10TargetType` uses `< 0` vs `IsRangeIn`'s `0 <`, asm `blt` confirmed). UI/save/menu track DONE: all 23 UI todo types reconstructed and compiling.
**Local-only artefacts:** `work/export/st01`, `work/unity_shaders8` (generated shaders, game-derived — never commit), Unity project `G:/Decomp/Rain/port_unity` (runtime scripts from `tools/unity/Runtime/` → `Assets/RainRuntime/`, editor scripts → `Assets/Editor/`).
**Housekeeping:** hosts file restored (backup `hosts.bak-rain`); Unity 4.7 removal approved by user.

## Completed and verified (evidence IDs: look up the pool in EVIDENCE.md, then open only that file in evidence/)
| Phase | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Feasibility | Both PKGs extracted; IL decrypted (SDAT, CMAC-verified); FIX EBOOT + 25 SPRX decrypted (zero klic); IL bodies stripped; same build as retail (MVIDs) | E1–E18 |
| 2 Foundation | REA capability map (no PPC64; .NET OK); Ghidra 12.1.4 works headless; native↔IL method mapping solved | T1–T8, E19–E29 |
| 3 RE (2 iterations) | Mono AOT v67 decoded (GOT/PLT/relocs) for all 4 game assemblies (9,118 methods); Ghidra fully annotated (Assembly-CSharp); 2 classes reconstructed; MonoBehaviour data 99.96 % byte-exact; all 892 FP + 390 VP validated; 1 shader → HLSL; game↔engine boundary (~60 PS3 APIs); call-graph closure | E30–E43, E52–E60 |
| Oracle | Retail+FIX installed in RPCS3; game fully playable (user: shaders, controls OK); FIX swaps title video/PARAM.SFO/KEYFILE | E44–E51 |
| 4 Planning | `PORTING_PLAN.md` (S1–S11, M0–M9, oracle method, risks) + target architecture in `ARCHITECTURE.md` | — |

## Outstanding tasks and blockers
- Approval of the plan / M0 (blocker for implementation).
- E53 vtable-slot mapping unresolved (planned in M0 via the RPCS3 GDB stub).
- 211 generic TypeSpec/MethodSpec names (E32); 4 MonoBehaviour classes not exact (E57).
- Ghidra annotation only done for Assembly-CSharp (other 3 assemblies have CSV maps but no Ghidra import yet).
- Optional, offered: restore the original `title_flow.mp4` in the RPCS3 install (removes the repack splash).
- Optional: switch the RPCS3 install to pure retail (RAP in exdata + retail EBOOT/files), removing the repack's splash.
